  <h1>TYPICAL ANGINA</h1>>

  <p>Angina pain is often described as squeezing, pressure, heaviness, tightness or pain in the chest. It may feel like a heavy weight lying on the chest. Angina may be a new pain that needs to be checked by a health care provider, or recurring pain that goes away with treatment.</p>

  <h1>ATYPICAL ANINA</h1>

  <p>Atypical angina is a classification of a form of chest pain called angina. The term “atypical” is used to describe a form of anginal chest pain that does not fit the typical presentation.</p>

  <h1>NON - ANGINAL PAIN</h1>

  <p>Non-cardiac chest pain (NCCP) is a term used to describe chest pain that resembles heart pain (also called angina) in patients who do not have heart disease. The pain typically is felt behind the breast bone (sternum) and is described as oppressive, squeezing or pressure-like.</p>

  <h1>ASYMPTOMATIC</h1>>

  <p>Chest pain appears in many forms, ranging from a sharp stab to a dull ache. Sometimes chest pain feels crushing or burning. In certain cases, the pain travels up the neck, into the jaw, and then spreads to the back or down one or both arms.</p>>
